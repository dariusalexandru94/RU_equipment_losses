# Russia's equipment losses in Ukraine: Perspectives from the Oryx open-source project and Ukrainian reports

**Through this analysis, we aim to examine the equipment losses of the Russian army in Ukraine, considering two distinct perspectives: 
The Oryx Project and the daily reports of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Additionally, after collecting data from these two sources, 
we have added another crucial element to the analysis: the cost of each individual piece of equipment. This was possible by using publicly 
available information about the prices of Russian military equipment, arms deals, and analysis from defense experts**

The first data source is the **Oryx Project**.

Oryx Project is a Dutch open-source intelligence defence analysis website, and warfare research group. The blog gained international 
prominence through its work during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, counting and keeping track of material losses based on visual 
evidence and open-source intelligence from social media. It has been regularly cited in major media, including Reuters, BBC News, 
The Guardian, The Economist, Newsweek, CNN, and CBS News. Forbes has called Oryx "the most reliable source in the conflict so far", 
calling its services "outstanding". Because **it reports only visually confirmed losses**, Forbes claimed that Oryx's tallies of 
equipment losses have formed absolute minimum baselines for loss estimates.

The second source of data is represented by the daily reports published by the **Ukrainian Ministry of Defense**.

Although it may be easily considered a subjective source of information, there are multiple journalistic investigations that demonstrate 
the accuracy of the Ukrainian figures. Additionally, estimates of Russian military losses made by British intelligence services align closely 
with the reports from the Ukrainians.
